# Forest-Walk Project User Manual
This repository contains the code for my submission to COMP 3931. There are two progams: the L-system editor and the forest simulator. Both have been developed for Linux, however the use of cross-platform libraries means that, in theory, this project should be compilable on Windows and Mac as well.
The UI for both programs was developed in QT 5.1. You should have this installed on your machine before building.

# L-system Editor (l-system-editor)
The L-system editor, as the name suggests, is a program which allows you to create and edit L-systems. To build the L-system editor, navigate to the root directory (/forest-walk/) of the project in a terminal. Then enter the following commands:
~~~~
cd Editor
qmake
make
~~~~
To run the editor, enter the command:
~~~~
./l-system-editor
~~~~

## Creating an L-system
There are three steps to creating an L-system in the editor. The first is to define your L-system's axiom, which can be done by entering it into the axiom text field. The second is to define your L-system's productions. To do so, there is initially one production field at the bottom of the interface. The add production button can be pressed to add a production field to the UI, with a maximum of 16. The minus button at the ends of each production field can be pressed to remove it. The final step, once all of your productions are defined, is to press the reload productions button. This will convert any expressions in your productions from infix to postfix.

There are 6 text fields in a single production field. The first 3 define the production's predecessor. The first and third boxes contain the predecessor's left and right contexts respectively. The fourth is the production's successor string. The fifth is the production's condition. The sixth is the production's probability. For stochastic productions, the probability value will be less than one and all stochastic productions which match a given predecessor should be grouped together. This is because the L-system derivation algorithm assumes that these productions will follow one after the other.

Once the reload productions button has been pressed, the L-system can be visualised. By pressing the derive button, a string held in memory, starting from the axiom, is derived. The derived string is then interpreted and visualised in the display widget.

Once defined, the L-system can be saved to a file. The file extension for an L-system specification is .lsys. For subsequent editing, the L-system can be loaded from the file and amended.

## Input language
The alphabet which is accepted by the program consists of parameterised "module" strings. A module is a single letter, with between 0 and 8 parameters. A parameter can be given as a real value or a parameterised expression.  Examples include @, F(0.5, 0.1), I(d) and A(t+1, q^(-x), 1.0). A production's successor can contain arithmetic expressions which are computed when the string in memory is derived. Any parameter symbols which appear in the successor must appear in only one of the predecessor fields. A branching structure can be described in a string by putting the contents of a branch between [ and ].

The models generated by the editor are done so with a LOGO-like turtle algorithm. This algorithm has a set list of symbols which correspond to instructions. The list of instructions and their symbols are as follows:

* **F(x,y)**: Move turtle forward by distance x and render a cylinder with length x and radius y. If y is not specified, then the radius defaults to a value stored within the turtle's state.
* **f(x)**: Move turtle forward by distance x but doesn't render a cylinder.
* **@(x)**: Render a sphere with radius x at the turtle's current position.
* **+(x)**: Turn the turtle left by x degrees.
* **-(x)**: Turn the turtle right by x degrees.
* **&(x)**: Roll the turtle forward by x degrees.
* **^(x)**: Roll the turtle backwards by x degrees.
* **/(x)**: Roll the turtle left by x degrees.
* **\\(x)**: Roll the turtle right by x degrees.
* **[**: Push the turtle's state onto a pushdown stack.
* **]**: Pop the top state from the pushdown stack and make it the turtle's current state.
* **{**: Begin saving the turtle's positions as vertices for a polygon.
* **}**: Fill the polygon.
* **.**: Store the turtle's current position as a polygon vertex. This only works when in between { and }. Currently, the only polygons which can be defined are quads, so a polygon will only be correctly drawn if four of these appear between { and }.
* **!(x)**: Change the default cylinder radius value to x.

# Forest Simulator (forest-walk)
The forest simulator (forest-walk) is a program which procedurally generates a forest.
To build the forest simulator, navigate to the root directory of the project in a terminal. Then enter the following commands:
~~~~
cd Core
qmake
./build.sh
~~~~
After entering the final command, a prompt with the text "gen stack code?" will be displayed. Just press enter to skip past it.
To run the simulator, enter the command:
~~~~
./forest-walk
~~~~
